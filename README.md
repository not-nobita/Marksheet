# Marksheet
This project is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based marksheet generator. It prompts the user to enter marks for each subject, calculates the total, percentage, result (Pass/Fail), and grade, then displays them dynamically in a styled marksheet layout that resembles an official exam certificate.
